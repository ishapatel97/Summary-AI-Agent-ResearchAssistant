# Summary-AI-Agent-ResearchAssistant
This project is built with Streamlit using an AI agent utilizing the Grok API (via langchain_groq) for natural language processing and the Semantic Scholar API for retrieving research papers. The AI agent, based on Grok's language model (Llama3-8b-8192), collaborates with FAISS for efficient similarity search and SentenceTransformer embeddings to rank summaries, enabling researchers to summarize, refine, and evaluate academic papers interactively. It’s designed to streamline literature reviews and support collaborative research workflows. For enhanced performance, you can optionally use OpenAI (a paid service) instead of Grok, though the default setup with Grok is free and effective.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Groq API Key: Obtain a Groq API key and set it in a .env file as GROQ_API_KEY=<your_key>.

Features
Paper Search: Fetches papers from the Semantic Scholar API based on user queries (e.g., "machine learning").
AI-Powered Summarization: Generates 3-sentence summaries of paper abstracts using the Grok-based AI agent.
Ranking: Ranks summaries by relevance using FAISS and SentenceTransformer embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Feedback & Refinement: Enables users to refine summaries via feedback, processed by the AI agent.
Metrics: Evaluates summary clarity (1-5) and provides improvement suggestions.
How the AI Agent Works: Step-by-Step
Input Query: The user enters a research topic (e.g., "machine learning") in the Streamlit interface.
Paper Retrieval: The AI agent sends the query to the Semantic Scholar API, fetching relevant papers with titles, abstracts, and URLs.
Summarization: For each paper’s abstract, the AI agent uses a predefined prompt ("Summarize this paper in 3 sentences") and the Grok model to generate concise summaries. (Optionally, switch to OpenAI for potentially better results, though it’s a paid service.)
Embedding & Ranking: The agent encodes summaries into vectors using SentenceTransformer, then uses FAISS to rank them based on similarity to the query’s embedding.
Display: Ranked summaries are shown in the Streamlit app, with clarity scores and improvement suggestions generated by the AI agent using a metrics prompt.
Feedback Loop: Users provide feedback on summaries, which the AI agent refines using a feedback prompt, updating the results interactively.
Iteration: The process repeats as users refine or explore new queries, leveraging the agent’s continuous learning capabilities.
Usage
Enter your Groq API key in the sidebar to activate the AI agent.
Input a research topic, click "Search and Summarize," and review AI-generated summaries.
Provide feedback to refine summaries and explore clarity metrics.
Repository Setup
.gitignore: A .gitignore file is included to exclude unnecessary files from version control, such as:
Virtual environment folders (venv/)
.env (to protect your API keys)
Python cache files (__pycache__/, *.pyc)
Learn more about ignoring files here.
License: The project includes an open-source license (e.g., MIT License) to specify what others can and can’t do with the code. Learn more about licenses here.
Additional Notes
The Semantic Scholar API powers paper retrieval—no extra API key needed, though rate limits apply.
A stable internet connection is required for API calls.
For superior summarization and refinement, consider using OpenAI (paid) instead of Grok by modifying the code to use the OpenAI API.
Customize prompts or models in the code for advanced functionality.
This tool harnesses an AI agent to empower researchers, students, and enthusiasts with an efficient, interactive way to navigate academic literature, with the flexibility to upgrade to OpenAI for premium results!
